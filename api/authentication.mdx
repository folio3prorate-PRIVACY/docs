# Authentication

All Octav API requests require authentication using API keys.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your Octav account at [octav.fi](https://octav.fi)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy and securely store your API key

<Alert type="error" title="Keep Your Keys Secret">
Never share your API keys or commit them to version control. Treat them like passwords.
</Alert>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.octav.fi/v1/wallets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Header Format

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## API Key Security

### Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables** - Store keys in environment variables, not in code
- **Rotate Keys Regularly** - Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones
- **Limit Key Scope** - Create separate keys for different applications
- **Monitor Usage** - Regularly review API key usage in your dashboard

### Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Create a new key for your application

## Rate Limiting

Authentication also determines your rate limits. Your plan level controls:

- Requests per hour
- Concurrent connections
- Data retention period

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

**Solution**: Check that your API key is correct and included in the Authorization header.

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "API key does not have access to this resource"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify your API key has the necessary permissions.

### 429 Too Many Requests

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "You have exceeded your hourly rate limit",
  "retry_after": 3600
}
```

**Solution**: Wait for the time specified in `retry_after` (seconds) or upgrade your plan.
