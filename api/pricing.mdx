## Credit Costs

### API Endpoints

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Free Endpoints (0 Credits)" icon="circle-check">
    These endpoints are completely free to call:

    | Endpoint | Method | Cost |
    |----------|--------|------|
    | `/v1/credits` | GET | **0 credits** |
    | `/v1/status` | GET | **0 credits** |

    Perfect for testing authentication and monitoring sync status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standard Endpoints (1 Credit)" icon="coins">
    Most API calls cost 1 credit:

    | Endpoint | Method | Cost |
    |----------|--------|------|
    | `/v1/portfolio` | GET | **1 credit** |
    | `/v1/transactions` | GET | **1 credit** |
    | `/v1/token-overview` | GET | **1 credit** P |
    | `/v1/historical` | GET | **1 credit** |
    | `/v1/sync-transactions` | POST | **1 credit** |

    P *Requires Octav PRO subscription*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction Indexing" icon="database">
    When syncing transactions, indexing costs apply:

    **1 credit per 250 transactions indexed**

    - First-time indexing of an address incurs indexing costs
    - Once indexed, transactions are stored permanently
    - Future queries don't re-index (no additional cost)
    - Only new transactions since last sync require indexing

    **One-Time Cost:** Indexing happens once. After initial sync, you only pay the 1 credit API call fee.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost Examples

### Example 1: Portfolio Tracking

Tracking 5 wallets, checking portfolios once per hour:

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Calls" icon="calculator">
    5 addresses x 24 hours x 30 days = **3,600 API calls**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credit Cost" icon="coins">
    3,600 calls x 1 credit = **3,600 credits**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly Cost" icon="dollar-sign">
    3,600 credits x $0.025 = **$90/month**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 2: Transaction History

Initial sync for an address with 10,000 transactions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Call" icon="code">
    1 sync-transactions call = **1 credit**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indexing Cost" icon="database">
    10,000 transactions / 250 = 40 batches x 1 credit = **40 credits**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Total First Sync" icon="calculator">
    1 + 40 = **41 credits** ($1.03)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Future Updates" icon="refresh">
    Only 1 credit per call for new transactions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 3: High-Volume Application

Application making 100,000 API calls per month:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starter Package" icon="seedling">
    **Not recommended** - Would need 25 packages

    100,000 credits x $0.025 = **$2,500**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Small Team Package" icon="users">
    **Perfect fit** - Exactly 100,000 credits

    1 package = **$2,500**

    **$0.025** per credit
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Intensive Usage" icon="rocket">
    **Best value** if you need flexibility

    Buy 1M credits for future growth

    100,000 used x $0.020 = **$2,000**

    **Save $500** with volume discount
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Credits Work

  </Card>

  <Card title="No Subscriptions" icon="ban">

  </Card>

  <Card title="Volume Discounts" icon="tag">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permanent Indexing Advantage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Permanent Indexing Saves Money" icon="piggy-bank">

When you sync an address for the first time:
1. **Pay indexing cost** - 1 credit per 250 transactions
2. **Transactions stored permanently** - Data saved in Octav's system
3. **Future queries are cheap** - Only 1 credit per API call
4. **No re-indexing costs** - Historical data already available

**Example:**
- First sync: 10,000 transactions = 41 credits ($1.03)
- Future calls: 1 credit each ($0.025)
- Query 100 times: 100 credits ($2.50)
- **Total: 141 credits vs re-indexing 4,100 credits each time**

This makes regular monitoring very cost-effective!

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring Usage

### Check Your Credits

Use the free `/v1/credits` endpoint anytime:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.octav.fi/v1/credits \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.octav.fi/v1/credits', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
  }
});

const credits = await response.json();
console.log(`Remaining credits: ${credits}`);
```

```python Python
response = requests.get(
    'https://api.octav.fi/v1/credits',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
)

credits = response.json()
print(f'Remaining credits: {credits}')
```

</CodeGroup>

## Cost Optimization Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Free Endpoints" icon="circle-check">
    Leverage the free `/v1/status` and `/v1/credits` endpoints:

    - Check sync status before calling expensive endpoints
    - Monitor credit balance without cost
    - Verify authentication without using credits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache Portfolio Data" icon="database">
    Portfolio data is cached for 1 minute:

    - Multiple calls within 1 minute return cached data
    - No need to implement your own caching for under 1 minute intervals
    - Use `waitForSync=false` (default) unless you need the absolute latest data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Addresses" icon="layer-group">
    Request multiple addresses in a single call:

    ```bash
    # Instead of 3 separate calls (3 credits):
    curl "https://api.octav.fi/v1/portfolio?addresses=0x123"
    curl "https://api.octav.fi/v1/portfolio?addresses=0x456"
    curl "https://api.octav.fi/v1/portfolio?addresses=0x789"

    # Use one call (1 credit):
    curl "https://api.octav.fi/v1/portfolio?addresses=0x123,0x456,0x789"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optimize Transaction Queries" icon="filter">
    Use filters to reduce unnecessary data:

    - Filter by `networks` to query specific chains
    - Use `txTypes` to get only relevant transaction types
    - Apply `startDate` and `endDate` for time-based queries
    - Set appropriate `limit` values for pagination
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Index Strategically" icon="brain">
    For addresses with 100,000+ transactions:

    - Contact support for assistance
    - Consider filtering by specific chains
    - Use date ranges to limit initial sync
    - Addresses over 100k transactions are not auto-indexed
  </Accordion>
