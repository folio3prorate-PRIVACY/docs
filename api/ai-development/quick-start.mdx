## Best Practices for Using These Prompts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customize for Your Needs" icon="pencil">
    **Don't use prompts verbatim:**

    - Add your specific requirements
    - Specify your exact tech stack
    - Include design preferences
    - Add any constraints (mobile-first, accessibility, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Context" icon="message">
    **Give AI more information:**

    ```
    "I'm building a portfolio tracker for a mobile app.
    Users are crypto beginners, so keep UI simple.
    Need to support dark mode.
    Budget: 10,000 API calls per month"
    ```

    More context = better code generation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate and Refine" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Build in stages:**

    1. Start with basic functionality
    2. Ask AI to add features one at a time
    3. Request improvements and optimizations
    4. Add error handling and edge cases

    ```
    "The portfolio tracker works! Now add:
    - Loading skeleton screens
    - Error states with retry button
    - Refresh button to update data"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate the Output" icon="shield-check">
    **Always review AI-generated code:**

    - Check API endpoint URLs are correct
    - Verify parameter names match Octav API
    - Test error handling
    - Review security (API key protection)
    - Test with real data
  </Accordion>
