Octav automatically categorizes all blockchain transactions into specific types, making it easy to filter, analyze, and understand on-chain activity.

<Info>
  **Smart Categorization** - Transactions are analyzed and categorized automatically based on method signatures, protocols, and transfer patterns

## Using Transaction Types

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Filter by Type
// Get only swaps
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.octav.fi/v1/transactions?addresses=${address}&txTypes=SWAP`,
  {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  }
);

const transactions = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${transactions.length} swaps`);
```

```javascript Multiple Types
// Get swaps and transfers
const types = ['SWAP', 'TRANSFERIN', 'TRANSFEROUT'];

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.octav.fi/v1/transactions?addresses=${address}&txTypes=${types.join(',')}`,
  {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  }
);
```

```javascript Analyze Transaction Mix
// Count transactions by type
function analyzeTransactionTypes(transactions) {
  const counts = {};

  transactions.forEach(tx => {
    const type = tx.txType;
    counts[type] = (counts[type] || 0) + 1;
  });

  // Sort by frequency
  const sorted = Object.entries(counts)
    .sort(([,a], [,b]) => b - a);

  return Object.fromEntries(sorted);
}

const analysis = analyzeTransactionTypes(transactions);
console.log('Most common:', Object.keys(analysis)[0]);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DeFi Activity" icon="coins">
    ```javascript
    // Get all DeFi-related transactions
    const DEFI_TYPES = [
      'SWAP', 'ADDLIQUIDITY', 'REMOVELIQUIDITY',
      'STAKE', 'UNSTAKE', 'LEND', 'BORROW',
      'DEPOSIT', 'WITHDRAW', 'CLAIM'
    ];

    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.octav.fi/v1/transactions?addresses=${address}&txTypes=${DEFI_TYPES.join(',')}`,
      {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
      }
    );
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Portfolio Changes" icon="chart-line">
    ```javascript
    // Track transactions that changed portfolio
    const PORTFOLIO_CHANGING = [
      'TRANSFERIN', 'TRANSFEROUT', 'SWAP',
      'ADDLIQUIDITY', 'REMOVELIQUIDITY',
      'STAKE', 'UNSTAKE', 'DEPOSIT', 'WITHDRAW',
      'CLAIM', 'AIRDROP', 'MINT'
    ];

    function getPortfolioChanges(transactions) {
      return transactions.filter(tx =>
        PORTFOLIO_CHANGING.includes(tx.txType)
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Exclude Spam" icon="filter">
    ```javascript
    // Filter out unwanted transactions
    const EXCLUDE_TYPES = ['SPAM', 'FAILED', 'APPROVAL', 'SIGN', 'IGNORE'];

    function cleanTransactions(transactions) {
      return transactions.filter(tx =>
        !EXCLUDE_TYPES.includes(tx.txType)
      );
    }

    const clean = cleanTransactions(allTransactions);
    console.log(`Kept ${clean.length} of ${allTransactions.length} txs`);
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Type Filters" icon="filter">
    Filter on the API side for better performance:

    ```javascript
    // Good - Filter on API
    const swaps = await fetch(
      `https://api.octav.fi/v1/transactions?addresses=${address}&txTypes=SWAP`
    );

    // Less efficient - Filter client-side
    const all = await fetch(
      `https://api.octav.fi/v1/transactions?addresses=${address}`
    );
    const swaps = all.filter(tx => tx.txType === 'SWAP');
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle MULTITYPE" icon="layer-group">
    MULTITYPE transactions may need special handling:

    ```javascript
    if (tx.txType === 'MULTITYPE') {
      // Transaction has multiple aspects
      // Check other fields for details
      console.log('Complex transaction:', tx);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Display User-Friendly Names" icon="tag">
    Convert type enums to readable labels:

    ```javascript
    const TYPE_LABELS = {
      'TRANSFERIN': 'Received',
      'TRANSFEROUT': 'Sent',
      'SWAP': 'Swapped',
      'ADDLIQUIDITY': 'Added Liquidity',
      'REMOVELIQUIDITY': 'Removed Liquidity',
      // ... etc
    };

    function getTypeLabel(txType) {
      return TYPE_LABELS[txType] || txType;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
