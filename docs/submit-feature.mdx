## Submit a Feature Request

We use **Canny** to collect and track feature requests from our community.

<Button href="https://octav.canny.io/feature-requests" variant="primary">Submit on Canny</Button>

### What You Can Do on Canny

- **Submit new feature ideas** - Share your suggestions for improvements
- **Vote on existing requests** - Upvote features you want to see
- **Comment and discuss** - Add details or use cases to feature requests
- **Track progress** - See which features are planned, in progress, or completed

<Alert type="tip" title="Check for Duplicates">
Before submitting, search existing requests to see if your idea has already been suggested. Upvote existing requests instead of creating duplicates!
