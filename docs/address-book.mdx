## Automatic Name Resolution

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ENS Names" icon="ethereum" iconType="brands">

    ### Ethereum Name Service

    **How ENS Works:**

    When you add an address with an ENS name:
    1. Enter the ENS name (e.g., `vitalik.eth`)
    2. Octav automatically resolves to the address
    3. Both ENS name and address are displayed
    4. You can still add a custom label

    **Display:**
    - **Label:** Your custom name (e.g., "Vitalik Wallet")
    - **ENS:** `vitalik.eth`
    - **Address:** `0xd8dA...6045`

    <Tip>
      **Best Practice** — Use custom labels even with ENS names for additional context (e.g., "Partnership - vitalik.eth")
    </Tip>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SNS Names" icon="https://images.octav.fi/chains/solana_icon.svg">

    ### Solana Name Service

    **How SNS Works:**

    When you add a Solana address with SNS:
    1. Enter the SNS name (e.g., `example.sol`)
    2. Octav resolves to the Solana address
    3. Both SNS name and address are shown
    4. Add custom label for organization

    **Display:**
    - **Label:** Your custom name (e.g., "Trading SOL")
    - **SNS:** `example.sol`
    - **Address:** `DYw8jC...CNSKK`

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reverse Resolution" icon="arrows-rotate">

    ### Automatic Name Detection

    **Adding by Address:**

    When you add an address that has an ENS/SNS name:
    1. Paste the wallet address
    2. Octav automatically checks for naming service
    3. If found, the name is displayed alongside address
    4. You add your custom label

    **Example:**
    - You paste: `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`
    - Octav detects: `vitalik.eth`
    - You see both address and ENS name
    - You add label: "Example Wallet"

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-Chain Tracking

<Info>
  **Automatic Cross-Chain Tracking** — When you add an address, Octav automatically tracks it across all 90+ supported blockchains.
</Info>

### How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="EVM Addresses" icon="link">

    **One Address, Multiple Chains**

    When you add an EVM address (0x...):
    - Automatically tracked on **all EVM chains**
    - Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche
    - And 80+ more EVM-compatible chains
    - All balances and transactions across chains appear in your dashboard

    **Example:**
    - Add address: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`
    - See balances on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum simultaneously
    - Track DeFi positions across all chains
    - View transactions from any chain

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Chain-Specific Addresses" icon="network-wired">

## Address Bundles

<Info>
  **Omnichain Bundles** — Group multiple wallet addresses together to see combined portfolio value across all chains. Bundle works with EVM, Solana, and Hyperliquid addresses simultaneously.
</Info>

### What are Bundles?

Bundles allow you to group related wallet addresses together to view their cumulative net worth and combined portfolio analytics.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Omnichain Support" icon="link">

    **Mix Any Chains**

    Bundles are chain-agnostic - combine addresses from any blockchain:

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Clear Naming" icon="tag" defaultOpen>

    **Use Descriptive Labels:**
    - Be specific with labels (e.g., "Hardware Wallet - Ledger" vs just "Wallet")
    - Include context (e.g., "Trading - DeFi", "Cold Storage - Long Term")
    - Use consistent naming patterns
    - Consider adding dates for time-based wallets

    **Good Examples:**
    - "Main Wallet - Daily Use"
    - "Hardware Wallet - Ledger Nano X"
    - "Trading Wallet - DeFi Strategies"
    - "Cold Storage - 2024 Holdings"

    **Poor Examples:**
    - "Wallet"
    - "My Address"
    - "Address 1"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize Your Wallets" icon="folder">

    **Logical Organization:**
    - Group similar wallets with naming prefixes
    - Use labels to indicate purpose
    - Create bundles for related addresses
    - Keep frequently used wallets at the top

    **Organization Examples:**
    - **By Purpose:** "Trading - Base", "Trading - Arbitrum", "Holding - Long Term"
    - **By Device:** "Ledger - Main", "Ledger - Backup", "MetaMask - Mobile"
    - **By Chain:** "ETH Main", "SOL Trading", "ARB DeFi"

    **Bundle Organization:**
    - Create bundles for portfolio segments (e.g., "DeFi Holdings", "Long-Term Storage")
    - Use bundles to track cross-chain strategies
    - Bundle addresses by ownership or purpose

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Review" icon="calendar">

    **Keep Your Address Book Clean:**
    - Review addresses periodically
    - Remove wallets you no longer use
    - Update labels as wallet purposes change
    - Verify ENS/SNS names are still resolving correctly

  </Accordion>
