## Magic Link Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Email Security" icon="envelope" defaultOpen>

    **Protect Your Email Account:**
    - Use a strong, unique password for your email
    - Enable two-factor authentication on your email account
    - Don't share your email credentials
    - Use a reputable email provider

    <Warning>
      **Email Access = Account Access** — Anyone with access to your email can sign in to your Octav account. Secure your email with strong authentication.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Link Expiration" icon="clock">

    **Magic Links Expire:**
    - Links are valid for 15 minutes
    - Each link can only be used once
    - Request a new link if yours has expired
    - Old links become invalid after use

    **If Your Link Expired:**
    1. Return to [beta.octav.fi](https://beta.octav.fi)
    2. Enter your email again
    3. Request a new magic link
    4. Check your inbox for the new link

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check the URL" icon="link">

    **Always Verify:**
    - Official domain: **beta.octav.fi**
